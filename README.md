WaysBeans is a web application that aims to attract coffee lovers and make them buy coffee from the project website. This application is built using ReactJS with ViteJS as the framework, and uses Tailwind CSS and HTML for styling. The backend is built using Go language and Echo as its framework. Security and authentication are ensured by implementing JWT and Bcrypt. The website is also integrated with a payment gateway called Midtrans.
